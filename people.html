  {% include person.html image="images/chintan.jpg" linkedin="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ozachintan" name="Chintan Oza" title="Post-Doc" desc="Chintan Oza is currently a Postdoctoral Associate in Biomedical Engineering at Duke. Originally from Gujarat, India, he received his bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Nirma Institute of Technology in Ahmedabad, India before immigrating to the US. Chintan obtained a master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Columbia University, NY and a Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Drexel University, PA. His Ph.D. research involved investigating cortical plasticity and locomotor recovery associated with robotic rehabilitation after spinal cord injury in rodents. His postdoctoral research at Duke involves investigating neural mechanisms of deep brain stimulation for movement disorders through preclinical studies in rodents and clinical studies in Parkinson’s and Essential tremor patients. Chintan is passionate about science advocacy and outreach and serves as the Council member and Chair of the Sponsorship committee with the Society for Neuroscience–Triangle chapter. Chintan also serves as the Chair of the Professional Development Committee at Duke University Postdoc Association. In his free time, Chintan listens to podcasts on science and religion, enjoys playing and watching cricket, Bollywood movies and music. In P[&lambda;]ab, Chintan helps lead our human intracranial recording projects." %}
