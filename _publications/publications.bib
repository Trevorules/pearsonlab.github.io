  abstract    = "Success in many decision-making scenarios depends on the
                 ability to maximize gains and minimize losses. Even if an
                 agent knows which cues lead to gains and which lead to losses,
                 that agent could still make choices yielding suboptimal
                 rewards. Here, by analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs)
                 recorded in humans during a probabilistic gambling task, we
                 show that individuals' behavioral tendencies to maximize gains
                 and to minimize losses are associated with their ERP responses
                 to the receipt of those gains and losses, respectively. We
                 focused our analyses on ERP signals that predict behavioral
                 adjustment: the frontocentral feedback-related negativity
                 (FRN) and two P300 (P3) subcomponents, the frontocentral P3a
                 and the parietal P3b. We found that, across participants, gain
                 maximization was predicted by differences in amplitude of the
                 P3b for suboptimal versus optimal gains (i.e., P3b amplitude
                 difference between the least good and the best gains).
                 Conversely, loss minimization was predicted by differences in
                 the P3b amplitude to suboptimal versus optimal losses (i.e.,
                 difference between the worst and the least bad losses).
                 Finally, we observed that the P3a and P3b, but not the FRN,
                 predicted behavioral adjustment on subsequent trials,
                 suggesting a specific adaptive mechanism by which prior
                 experience may alter ensuing behavior. These findings indicate
                 that individual differences in gain maximization and loss
                 minimization are linked to individual differences in rapid
                 neural responses to monetary outcomes.",

                 among competing actions takes place in the presence of
                 informative, but potentially ambiguous, stimuli. Decisions
                 about magnitudes - quantities like time, length, and
                 brightness that are linearly ordered - constitute an important
                 subclass of such decisions. It has long been known that
                 perceptual judgments about such quantities obey Weber's Law,
                 wherein the just-noticeable difference in a magnitude is
                 proportional to the magnitude itself. Current physiologically
                 inspired models of numerical classification assume
                 discriminations are made via a labeled line code of neurons
                 selectively tuned for numerosity, a pattern observed in the
                 firing rates of neurons in the ventral intraparietal area
                 (VIP) of the macaque. By contrast, neurons in the contiguous
                 lateral intraparietal area (LIP) signal numerosity in a graded
                 fashion, suggesting the possibility that numerical
                 classification could be achieved in the absence of neurons
                 tuned for number. Here, we consider the performance of a
                 decision model based on this analog coding scheme in a
                 paradigmatic discrimination task - numerosity bisection. We
                 demonstrate that a basic two-neuron classifier model, derived

                 neurons, is sufficient to reproduce the numerosity bisection
                 behavior of monkeys, and that the threshold of the classifier
                 can be set by reward maximization via a simple learning rule.
                 In addition, our model predicts deviations from Weber Law
                 scaling of choice behavior at high numerosity. Together, these
                 results suggest both a generic neuronal framework for
                 magnitude-based decisions and a role for reward contingency in

                 explore/exploit behavior has not been previously investigated
                 in the context of addiction. The explore/exploit trade-off is
                 captured by the multiarmed bandit task, in which different
                 arms of a slot machine are chosen to discover the relative
                 payoffs. The goal of this study was to preliminarily
                 investigate whether smokers differ from nonsmokers in their
                 degree of exploratory behavior. Smokers (n = 18) and
                 nonsmokers (n = 17) completed a 6-armed bandit task as well as

                 Sexual selection may favor attention mechanisms allowing the
                 choosing females to selectively and efficiently acquire
                 relevant information from complex male display traits and, in
                 turn, may favor male display traits that effectively capture
                 and hold female attention. Using a miniaturized telemetric
                 gaze-tracker, we show that peahens (Pavo cristatus)
                 selectively attend to specific components of peacock courtship
                 displays and virtually ignore other, highly conspicuous

                 against larger/later ones, are frequently used to study time
                 preferences and, by extension, impulsivity and self-control.
                 When used in animals, many trials are strung together in
                 sequence and an adjusting buffer is added after the
                 smaller/sooner option to hold the total duration of each trial
                 constant. Choices of the smaller/sooner option are not reward
                 maximizing and so are taken to indicate that the animal is
                 discounting future rewards. However, if animals fail to
                 correctly factor in the duration of the postreward buffers,
                 putative discounting behavior may instead reflect constrained
                 reward maximization. Here, we report three results consistent
                 with this discounting-free hypothesis. We find that (i)
                 monkeys are insensitive to the association between the

                 of the postreward delay biases monkeys toward the larger/later
                 option, reducing measured discounting rates. These results are
                 incompatible with standard discounting-based accounts but are

                 mechanisms are often duplicated, repurposed, and

                 on recent research from nonhuman primates, we describe how the

                 extending preexisting mechanisms that previously supported
                 nonsocial functions. This approach reveals that highly
                 specialized mechanisms have evolved to decipher the immediate
                 social context, and parallel circuits have evolved to
                 translate social perceptual signals and nonsocial perceptual

                 incorporate not only recent reward history, but also
                 opportunity costs and environmental statistics. Previous

                 experiments, preferring smaller, sooner rewards to larger,
                 delayed rewards even when this reduces average reward rates.
                 By contrast, the same animals often engage in natural
                 behaviors that require extreme patience, such as food caching,
                 stalking prey, and traveling long distances to high-quality
                 food sites. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is
                 that standard laboratory delay discounting tasks artificially
                 inflate impulsivity by subverting animals' common learning
                 strategies. To test this idea, we examined choices made by
                 rhesus macaques in two variants of a standard delay

                 surprisingness. Concordant with this behavioral pattern,

                 Moreover, when, on some trials, probabilities were hidden,
                 neuronal responses to rewards were reduced, consistent with
                 the idea that the absence of clear expectations diminishes

                 The answer depends on current needs, behavioral flexibility
                 and prior knowledge about the environment. Formal approaches
                 solve the problem by integrating the recent history of
                 rewards, errors, uncertainty and context via Bayesian
                 inference to detect changes in the world and alter behavioral
                 policy. Neuronal activity in posterior cingulate cortex - a
                 key node in the default network - is known to vary with
                 learning, memory, reward and task engagement. We propose that
                 these modulations reflect the underlying process of change
                 detection and motivate subsequent shifts in behavior.",

  abstract    = "Foundational studies in decision making focused on behavior as
                 the most accessible and reliable data on which to build
                 theories of choice. More recent work, however, has
                 incorporated neural data to provide insights unavailable from
                 behavior alone. Among other contributions, these studies have
                 validated reinforcement learning models by demonstrating
                 neural signals posited on the basis of behavioral work in
                 classical and operant conditioning. In such models, the values
                 of actions or options are updated incrementally based on the
                 difference between expectations and outcomes, resulting in the
                 gradual acquisition of stable behavior. By contrast, natural
                 environments are often dynamic, including sudden, unsignaled
                 shifts in reinforcement contingencies. Such rapid changes may
                 necessitate frequent shifts in behavioral mode, requiring
                 dynamic sensitivity to environmental changes. Recently, we
                 proposed a model in which cingulate cortex plays a key role in
                 detecting behaviorally relevant environmental changes and
                 facilitating the update of multiple behavioral strategies.
                 Here, we connect this framework to a model developed to handle
                 the analogous problem in motor control. We offer a tentative
                 dictionary of control signals in terms of brain structures and
                 highlight key differences between motor and decision systems
                 that may be important in evaluating the model.",
