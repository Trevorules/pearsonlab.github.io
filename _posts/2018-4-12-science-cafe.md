John recently gave a talk in Raleigh as part of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science's [Science Cafe](https://livestream.com/naturalsciences/Cafe) series. The talk was originally titled "Not quite SkyNet: Three things my two-year-old can do that Google still can't." Perhaps this was a little too tongue-in-cheek, since the talk was billed under a different title, but a video of the event is up on YouTube:
