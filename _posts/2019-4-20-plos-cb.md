We have two new papers out on dynamic and strategic decision making. 

The first, published in PLoS Computational Biology as ["Latent goal models for dynamic strategic interaction"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006895), proposed a new model that is capable of reproducing the rich behavior of monkeys playing against each other in a dynamic decision task. 

Our second paper was published in Nature Communications, ["Bayesian nonparametric models characterize instantaneous strategies in a competitive dynamic game"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09789-4). Here, we used Gaussian Processes to model the policy and value functions of participants as a function of both game state and opponent identity. 

Congrats to Sam and Kelsey in particular for their hard work!
