# Postdocs
We're always interested in talking to qualified postdoc candidates. Particularly those with backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Physics, or any other field where you do applied math for a living. Neuroscience experience is not required, though neuroscience interest is.

### Current openings:
- **Legal decision-making**

  An interdisciplinary team of lawyers and cognitive neuroscientists at Duke University seeks a postdoctoral fellow to join a recently funded project on decision making by jurors, prosecutors, and defense attorneys in criminal trials. The project combines a high-throughput behavioral task with computational modeling to examine how decision makers integrate conflicting evidence, intrinsic biases and motivations when deciding whether someone accused of a crime is guilty. The successful candidate will have opportunities to engage with experienced prosecutors and defense attorneys as well as a vibrant community of cognitive and computational neuroscientists at Duke.

  The position is available immediately. Send cv and letter of interest to `john dot pearson at duke dot edu`.

  Programming proficiency with JavaScript and experience with Bayesian statistics are preferred. Experience in survey design is also helpful. Previous legal experience is not necessary, but an interest in law and legal decision making is important.

 - **Statistical analysis of neural data**

    The laboratory of Dr. John Pearson ([http://pearsonlab.github.io](http://pearsonlab.github.io)) has an opening for a postdoctoral researcher focused on the statistical analysis of neural data. This is a one-year full-time position with the possibility of renewal. Women and minority candidates are particularly encouraged to apply.

    Located in the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu/) and the [Center for Cognitive Neuroscience](https://dibs.duke.edu/centers/ccn) at Duke, the Pearson Lab focuses on designing and implementing new approaches to the analysis of large-scale neuroscience data including:

    - modeling complex, dynamic social interactions
    - analysis of simultaneous neural recordings during naturalistic behavior
    - real-time analysis of streaming data from imaging experiments

    <br>

    Candidates should hold a PhD in statistics, computer science, electrical engineering, or any other sufficiently quantitative field and have a strong record of peer-reviewed journal and/or conference publications. Strong programming skills required. Experience with statistical machine learning and streaming algorithms a plus. 

    Interested? Send a brief cover letter, cv, and source code sample (github/bitbucket/gitlab link preferred) to `john dot pearson at duke dot edu`.


# Graduate students
Duke provides a wonderful environment for students interested in pursuing the kind of interdisciplinary research we do. As a result, P[&lambda;]ab accepts graduate students through multiple programs:

- [Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu/). The [PhD in biostatistics](https://biostat.duke.edu/education/phd-biostatistics/overview) is a rigorous program that focuses on statistical theory and its application to biomedical research. The program is small, and like most programs at Duke, highly competitive. Compared to neuroscience PhD programs, the number of required courses is high, and many admitted students enter having completed a master's degree. This is John's home department.

- [Cognitive Neuroscience Admitting Program](https://dibs.duke.edu/centers/ccn/graduate-cnap). Unlike most PhD programs, CNAP is not tied to a single department. Rather, it gives students the opportunity to explore interdisciplinary research in cognitive neuroscience before ultimately affiliating with a department like Psychology & Neuroscience or Neurobiology. CNAP is administered by the [Center for Cognitive Neuroscience](https://dibs.duke.edu/centers/ccn), which includes faculty whose interests range from speech and development to neurons and computation. Students do three semester-long rotations and are often jointly mentored. The typical CNAP student has a strong interest in cognition and is looking to pursue research that crosses traditional departmental boundaries. John is a core faculty member of CCN.

- [Neurobiology](https://www.neuro.duke.edu/). The Department of Neurobiology offers a PhD through its [graduate training program](https://www.neuro.duke.edu/education/graduate-training-program). Research in the department focuses on biological and mechanistic approaches, typically at the cellular and molecular or systems and circuits level. John is a member of the training faculty and can accept students for rotations or PhD mentorship.

- [Psychology and Neuroscience](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/). The department offers a [PhD program](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/graduate) with emphases in multiple areas, including Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience and Systems and Integrative Neuroscience. John has a secondary appointment in the department and can accept students.

**If you plan on applying,** keep a few things in mind:
- It's best to contact John in advance if you have a strong interest in our lab. Some programs may be a better fit for you than others.
- Graduate students cost money. Sadly, we don't have enough funding to support all the talented students who might be interested. Again, contacting John early in the application process is the best way to find out if we have slots available.
- We really prioritize students with quantitative skills. PhD students in the lab will spend the bulk of their time coding, analyzing, and deriving and so should expect to take additional courses in statistics and machine learning, even if those are not required by their program. We value previous experience in neuroscience, but we are particularly looking for:
    - Demonstrated mathematical ability (usually coursework).
    - Strong coding skills (public code, open source contributions, version control, testing).
    - Experience analyzing data (statistical modeling, simulation, machine learning).

# Full-Time Research Associates
We sometimes advertise positions for research associates/data scientists. These roles are best-suited to post-baccalaureate students who plan to go on to graduate school or careers in data science. Applicants should send a cv, cover letter, and code sample (GitHub/BitBucket/Gitlab profile preferred) to John for consideration. Again, we prioritize applicants with strong coding and quantitative skills.

# Undergraduates

P[&lambda;]ab offers undergraduates several opportunities to contribute to the work of the lab:
- Through an independent study.
- Through a senior thesis.
- Through work-study or undergraduate research assistantships.
- Through several [summer research opportunities](https://undergraduateresearch.duke.edu/opportunities). (N.B.: John really doesn't know much about these, so if this is a route you'd like to take, it's up to you to figure out what programs would allow you to work with us.)

A few points to note:
- There is very little busy work in the lab. Many of the traditional grunt tasks assigned to undergraduate researchers either don't exist (collecting and organizing data) or are highly technical (setting up and running cloud environments). All of our projects involve computer programming. Most involve some math. To be a successful undergraduate researcher, you must be able to contribute meaningfully, and that requires a certain level of technical skill at the outset.
- That said, if you are interested in working with us and willing to put in the time, we have a [list of resources for self-study](../learning.html). John is also willing to meet and discuss what informal mentoring along these lines might look like.  
- For reasons of equity, **we pay all our undergraduate researchers.** We might ask you for a brief trial period, but we do not in general offer unpaid internships. This means, in practice, that the bar for accepting students into the lab is high (though cf. the previous point).
